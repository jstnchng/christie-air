*Description*:
The parts of our original proposal that we implemented:
	The user can search for:
	flights going out of and going to a particular airport
	flights from a particular airline
	find past ticket records for a customer given email/ first name/ last name/ phone number/ flight number
	find cheapest flight prices given origin/ destination/ airline/ departure date/ arrival date (all fields are optional)
	find status of a flight and departure times/ arriving times given flight number
The parts of our original proposal not implemented:
	We didn’t have functionality to find the gate a flight leaves out of, because our schema changed to no longer include gate. 
	We also didn’t have functionality to book a flight, we built our website to provide information rather than serve as a booking website.
The parts not from our original proposal that we implemented:
	find frequent flyer account information for a customer given customer email
	search all airplanes owned by a particular airline



Briefly describe two of the web pages that require (what you consider) the most interesting database operations in terms of what the pages are used for, how the page is related to the database operations (e.g., inputs on the page are used in such and such way to produce database operations that do such and such), and why you think they are interesting.
